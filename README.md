### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m YoungGaLee

<br>
    
I teach IoT in high school.    
I wanna be a good teacher also a developer.    
<br>
To find the lost sense of coding, I want to develop a habit of writing code and pushing every day.    

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Maker class using ESP32 board and node-red
